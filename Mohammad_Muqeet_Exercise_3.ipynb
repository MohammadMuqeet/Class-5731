            "In this uncertain Covid era, we learned it was wise to have an Oximeter on hand to measure oxygen levels. As I started to research, I immediately discounted brands new to the market since the onset of Covid-19. Instead, I found two that had many longtime reviews from satisfied users. Two stood out, the Zacurate Pro Series 500DL and the MiBest Oximeter. To my surprise, virtually everything was sold out and I thought I’d struck gold simply by scoring a MiBest after it was almost always out of stock. Once I’d ordered the MiBest and delivery was delayed, I found the Zacurate and ordered it, too. Which is best?See the photo above with Zacurate in black at left, and MiBest at right. One thing to know up front is that prices are skyrocketing for finger oximeters. They are suddenly hot items on the market. Some quick research showed that the well regarded MiBest had been selling for $30 for years, but at the time of this review its price is fluctuating between $50 and $55 when purchased directly from the company. The Zacurate has always been priced at less than $30 and I felt lucky to score one to compare to the more expensive MiBest.As it turns out, the Zacurate came a week faster than the MiBest. Simply put, it’s fantastic. Is $30 too good to be true when others can be $50 and up? I truly applaud Zacurate for not taking advantage at this time of tight finances for many in need of reliable health monitoring. It comes with a useful manual yet I learned the most from quick Internet research, such as normal health oxygen levels are between 94-100 and levels lower than that but still above 90 are normal for others. If your reading is under 90, consult your doctor.The Zacurate is consistent for both oxygen and pulse readings. Place it on a flat surface, stick your index finger in, bottom side down, press button to turn on unit and wait 5-6 seconds for the readout.When the MiBest came a few weeks after I ordered it, we were already 100% satisfied with the Zacurate. It does not include much documentation but also works well and has consistent readings. If you feel you must have an oximeter in hand ASAP, and the MiBest is available, I do recommend it yet am disappointed its price at $50-55 has nearly doubled.If you can find Zacurate available, and it costs less than the MiBest, it’s the clear first choice. It’s a trusted and very easy to use oximeter at a great price for home users like us, and medical professionals, too. Its readout is vertical, just as your finger will be. Thus, it's easier to read than the horizontally oriented MiBest.I hope this long review has been of some assistance and wish you and yours good health and strength. We believe better days are ahead.\n",

Simply put, it’s fantastic. Is $30 too good to be true when others can be $50 and up? I truly applaud Zacurate for not taking advantage at this time of tight finances for many in need of reliable health monitoring. It comes with a useful manual yet I learned the most from quick Internet research, such as normal health oxygen levels are between 94-100 and levels lower than that but still above 90 are normal for others. If your reading is under 90, consult your doctor.The Zacurate is consistent for both oxygen and pulse readings. Place it on a flat surface, stick your index finger in, bottom side down, press button to turn on unit and wait 5-6 seconds for the readout.When the MiBest came a few weeks after I ordered it, we were already 100% satisfied with the Zacurate. It does not include much documentation but also works well and has consistent readings. If you feel you must have an oximeter in hand ASAP, and the MiBest is available, I do recommend it yet am disappointed its price at $50-55 has nearly doubled.If you can find Zacurate available, and it costs less than the MiBest, it’s the clear first choice. It’s a trusted and very easy to use oximeter at a great price for home users like us, and medical professionals, too. Its readout is vertical, just as your finger will be. Thus, it's easier to read than the horizontally oriented MiBest.I hope this long review has been of some assistance and wish you and yours good health and strength. We believe better days are ahead.\n",

Place it on a flat surface, stick your index finger in, bottom side down, press button to turn on unit and wait 5-6 seconds for the readout.When the MiBest came a few weeks after I ordered it, we were already 100% satisfied with the Zacurate. It does not include much documentation but also works well and has consistent readings. If you feel you must have an oximeter in hand ASAP, and the MiBest is available, I do recommend it yet am disappointed its price at $50-55 has nearly doubled.If you can find Zacurate available, and it costs less than the MiBest, it’s the clear first choice. It’s a trusted and very easy to use oximeter at a great price for home users like us, and medical professionals, too. Its readout is vertical, just as your finger will be. Thus, it's easier to read than the horizontally oriented MiBest.I hope this long review has been of some assistance and wish you and yours good health and strength. We believe better days are ahead.\n",

            "In this uncertain Covid era, we learned it was wise to have an Oximeter on hand to measure oxygen levels. As I started to research, I immediately discounted brands new to the market since the onset of Covid-19. Instead, I found two that had many longtime reviews from satisfied users. Two stood out, the Zacurate Pro Series 500DL and the MiBest Oximeter. To my surprise, virtually everything was sold out and I thought I’d struck gold simply by scoring a MiBest after it was almost always out of stock. Once I’d ordered the MiBest and delivery was delayed, I found the Zacurate and ordered it, too. Which is best?See the photo above with Zacurate in black at left, and MiBest at right. One thing to know up front is that prices are skyrocketing for finger oximeters. They are suddenly hot items on the market. Some quick research showed that the well regarded MiBest had been selling for $30 for years, but at the time of this review its price is fluctuating between $50 and $55 when purchased directly from the company. The Zacurate has always been priced at less than $30 and I felt lucky to score one to compare to the more expensive MiBest.As it turns out, the Zacurate came a week faster than the MiBest. Simply put, it’s fantastic. Is $30 too good to be true when others can be $50 and up? I truly applaud Zacurate for not taking advantage at this time of tight finances for many in need of reliable health monitoring. It comes with a useful manual yet I learned the most from quick Internet research, such as normal health oxygen levels are between 94-100 and levels lower than that but still above 90 are normal for others. If your reading is under 90, consult your doctor.The Zacurate is consistent for both oxygen and pulse readings.

Well, one late night, around 3 or 4 AM I was really having issues, sucking down inhalers, well...  Not really inhalers,  They were over the counter vaporizer meds with ephedrine.  Which, opens airways, but also many side effects.  Basically, its NOT an emergency inhaler.  Anyway,  I just happen to have this product and put it on my finger, and watched my O2 drop slowly that morning from mid 80s, low 80's , high 70s and now its going crazy, and I don't think its the device...ok 911 time... At this time I couldn't even think... It is something every home / first aid kit should have, with a spare battery for it!\n",

        "Working on extracting features from text data was an insightful learning experience. One of the key concepts I found most beneficial was understanding the importance of preprocessing text data, including steps like removing special characters, lowercasing, and eliminating stopwords. Additionally, learning about part-of-speech tagging and its role in extracting linguistic features was valuable.\n",

        "Challenges Encountered:\n",
        "One of the challenges encountered during this exercise was ensuring the compatibility of different libraries and modules used for text preprocessing, such as NLTK and TextBlob. Managing dependencies and resolving version conflicts required careful attention. Additionally, understanding the nuances of feature extraction techniques and choosing the most relevant features for the task posed some difficulty.\n",

        "Relevance to Field of Study:\n",
        "This exercise directly relates to the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). Feature extraction is a fundamental step in NLP tasks such as sentiment analysis, text classification, and information retrieval. By extracting and representing relevant features from text data, NLP models can better understand and interpret the underlying semantics, leading to more accurate and meaningful analyses. Therefore, mastering feature extraction techniques is crucial for anyone working in NLP or related fields.\n",
